# Titanic Data Cleaning and Visualization

## Project Purpose
This project demonstrates data cleaning and preprocessing techniques using the Titanic dataset. The goal is to handle missing data, normalize values, and visualize various aspects of the dataset.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and explore its structure.
2. **Handling Missing Data**: Impute missing values for `Age` and `Embarked`, and drop `Cabin` due to excessive missing values.
3. **Data Transformation**: Convert categorical data to numeric and apply one-hot encoding.
4. **Normalization/Scaling**: Normalize the `Age` and `Fare` columns.
5. **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Detect outliers in the `Fare` column and remove them.
6. **Visualization**: Create various charts to explore the dataset.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scipy

## Results
- **Data Cleaning**: Missing data was handled, and data was transformed and normalized.
- **Visualizations**: Multiple plots (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, bar plots, heatmaps, etc.) were created to analyze the dataset.
